# Intro

Hello everyone! I'm Andres Morales, a Software Development Engineer working for Amazon (San Jos√©, Costa Rica). My current areas of interest are Computer Engineering,  Software Architecture, and Artificial Intelligence. I also enjoy playing and creating games, playing the piano, and listening to music.

For some time I have been thinking about creating a blog and personal website to share my thoughts and knowledge. I recently started working as a professor and I'd like to keep in touch with my students in some way, which is why I actually started working on getting my own website/blog running. 

## Purpose 
The main idea of this blog is to write tutorials about general Python programming, Pandas, and post-mortems for my projects, like finishing a course, participating in a hackathon ([Ludum Dare](https://ldjam.com/)?) or any other idea that I feel like writing about. I don't have any planned cadence of how often I'll be writing my posts, but I wanted to start writing so I feel this is a great oportunity.

## Current projects
The current projects I'm working on and I'll eventually write about them on this blog are:
* [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) Challenge: This year I wanted to do more code puzzles and challenges, that's why I decided to participate in this event this year, I'm not in for being the first one on the leaderboard but for the fun!
* University Professor: As I told you before, I started working as a professor for [Ucenfotec](https://www.ucenfotec.ac.cr/), a local University here in Costa Rica. I want to write a post-mortem about my experience and what I think I could improve if there's another chance for me to work as a professor. 
* We are building a house!: This one is my biggest project so far this year. We (my girlfriend and me) started to build a house around March this year, and it is scheduled to end somewhere around mid-January.
